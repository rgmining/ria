algorithm is an algorithm we've introduced in DEXA 2011,
[Repeated Improvement Analysis (RIA)](http://db-event.jpn.org/deim2015/paper/253.pdf) algorithm
is an algorithm we've introduced in DEIM 2015.
Algorithm **One** has been proposed by Ee-Peng Lim *ea al.* in CIKM 2010, and algorithm **OneSum** is an variation of it made by us.

This package is a part of [Review Graph Mining Project](https://rgmining.github.io/)
which provides other algorithms, datasets, and helper libraries.

See [the documents](https://rgmining.github.io/ria/) for more information.
