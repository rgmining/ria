algorithm is an algorithm we've introduced in DEXA 2011, `Repeated
Improvement Analysis
(RIA) <http://db-event.jpn.org/deim2015/paper/253.pdf>`__ algorithm is
an algorithm we've introduced in DEIM 2015. Algorithm **One** has been
proposed by Ee-Peng Lim *ea al.* in CIKM 2010, and algorithm **OneSum**
is an variation of it made by us.

This package is a part of `Review Graph Mining
Project <https://rgmining.github.io/>`__ which provides other
algorithms, datasets, and helper libraries.
